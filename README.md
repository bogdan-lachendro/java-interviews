# Java Refactorings

The purpose of this is to have an example to work through refactoring and to discuss potential ways of solving the problems. 
There is no one perfect way to refactor anything, so they way different folks do it can spark debate and conversations.

What we should strive for is the following

1. Follow [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
2. Create clean code that is easy to read
   1. Consistent spacing, # of blank lines
   2. Not too much 1 liners, but class is short and single responsibility
   3. Naming is obvious
   4. Comments are unnecessary since naming is obvious
3. Have code that is easily unit testable
   1. Mock everything (which may change how you write the code)

So for each example in main there is a script file that will checkout the example 
and then create a branch based on your user name.

Take the code and refactor it to what you think it should be, then look at the 
other branches to see how others did it.
